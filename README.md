## ML-ANN-Perovskite-lattice-constant-prediction
The notebook can be opened in google colab or kaggle. I would prefer to open it jupyter-lab in my laptop.
I have performed a regression ML task using artificial neural networks to obtain the lattice constant of the Perovskite ($ABO_{3}$) group of compound.

The mean absolute error of the model is around 0.05.
