## ML-ANN-Perovskite-lattice-constant-prediction
The notebook can be opened in google colab or kaggle. Or jupyter-lab would be a good option as well.
I have performed a regression ML task using artificial neural networks to obtain the lattice constant of the Perovskite (ABO3) group of compound.

The mean absolute error of the model is around 0.05. I also  performed a GridSearch for three hyperparamters namely, learning rate, number of hidden layers and number of neurons per layer.
